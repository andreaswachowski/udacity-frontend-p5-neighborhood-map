# Neighborhood Map
A project from Udacity's Front-end Web Developer Nano degree.

# Remarks:
* No attempt is being made at making the project work across older
  browsers. For example, the CSS is not using any specific browser prefixes
  (for that, I would employ
  [grunt-autoprefixer](https://github.com/nDmitry/grunt-autoprefixer)).
* CSS is intentionally on the light side, so no Bootstrap or Foundation.
